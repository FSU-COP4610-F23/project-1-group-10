## How to Compile & Execute

### Requirements
- **Compiler**: gcc -std=c99 nameOfFile -o whatYouWantTheExecutableToBeNamed
- **Dependencies**: None needed to be downloaded

### Compilation
```bash
make
```
This will build the executable alongside the makefile and other folders 
in this directory. It will also create the bin and obj folders in the same
directory.
### Execution
```bash
make run
```
This will run the program and start off with a slightly different prompt than
before. 
## Bugs
- **Bug 1**: Printing out the command line gives a segmentation fault.
- **Bug 2**: Piping doesn't seem to be going into the background.
- **Bug 3**: This is bug 3.

## Extra Credit
- **Extra Credit 1**: [Support unlimited number of pipes]
- **Extra Credit 2**: [Extra Credit Option]
- **Extra Credit 3**: [Extra Credit Option]
